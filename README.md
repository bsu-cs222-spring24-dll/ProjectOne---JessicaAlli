This project aims to create a Java application that interacts with the Wikipedia API to retrieve information about recent changes to a specified Wikipedia article. It utilizes Gradle for project management and dependencies. The application prompts users to input the title of the Wikipedia article they wish to explore. It then fetches the most recent revisions of the article using HTTP requests and parses the JSON response to extract relevant data such as timestamps and usernames. The program handles various scenarios, including missing article pages and network errors, providing appropriate error messages. It also displays the 14 most recent changes, showing timestamps in ISO 8601 format and corresponding usernames, or all changes if fewer than 14 exist.
