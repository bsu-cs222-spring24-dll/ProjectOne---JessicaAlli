This project allows the user to input the name of a Wikipedia article, then the program retrieves up to 14 of the most recent revisions with the username of the revisor and a timestamp of when the revision was completed. 

Build Instructions: Go to Article.java in src/main/java/edu/bsu/cs and run the main function. (Iteration 1)

** It was attempted to remove the WikiGUI package before final submission, but removal of this file caused the entire project to not recognize the build.gradle file, so it was determined that this package would be left in despite it being unneccessary.
** Code for the GUI (src/main/java/edu/bsu/cs/GUI.java) is present but to our knowledge is non-functional due to an error with JavaFX: "JavaFX runtime components are missing, and are required to run this application". This issue was not able to be resolved prior to submission.
